About sauceclient
=================

`sauceclient` is a Python client library, used for accessing the Sauce Labs
API to retrieve and update information about resources such as:

 * Account
 * Information
 * JavaScript Unit Tests
 * Jobs & Assets (Logs, Videos, Screenshots)
 * Temporary Storage
 * Tunnels

`sauceclient` is *not* used for running your tests on Sauce Labs' service.
(That is done via `Selenium WebDriver`_).

Install

      pip install sauceclient

test coverage.

Example sauceclient Usage
=========================

 * public access::

    import sauceclient

    sc = sauceclient.SauceClient()

        'sauce-username',
        'sauce-access-key',
    )
